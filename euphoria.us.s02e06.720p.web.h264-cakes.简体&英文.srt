给  宝贝
Here, baby.

18
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,750
小茹
Rue?

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,180
宝贝  你得喝水  好吗
Baby, I need, I need you to drink this, okay?

20
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:47,110
喝吧  喝吧
Come on, come on.

21
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,200
就喝一口  宝贝  求你了
Let's just take a sip, baby, please.

22
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,520
要我帮你剥吗
Do you need help with that?

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,890
我扶住你了
I got you.

24
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,150
知道我喜欢医院哪一点吗
You know what I like about hospitals?

25
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,230
快到了  加油
We're almost there. Come on.

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,160
他们不用知道你是不是个好人
They don't need to know how good of a person you are

27
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,920
就会照顾你
in order to take care of you.

28
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,200
加油
Come on.

29
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,840
他们不需要知道你脑子里在想什么
They don't need to know what's going on in your head

30
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,070
就会在你胳膊上缠好绷带
before they wrap a bandage around your arm.

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,580
加油
Come on.

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,940
这样的人很少见
People like that are rare.

33
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,980
那个医生让我妈妈联系了一家
The doctor put my mom in touch with a rehab,

34
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,390
下周初可能有空床位的戒毒所
who might have an open bed early next week.

35
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,190
好了  好了
Okay, okay.

36
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,510
让我坚持住
Told me to stay strong.

37
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,290
好了  好了  好了
Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,640
我妈也属于那种少见的人
My mom is one of those rare people,

39
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,140
但也许是因为她是我妈
but maybe that's 'cause she's my mom.

40
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,970
另外  她在教堂长大
She also grew up in the church.

41
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,410
随便你说基督徒怎样
And say what you want about Christians.

42
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,870
至少他们相信宽恕
At least they believe in forgiveness.

43
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,750
我不记得任何我对我妈说过的话
I don't remember everything I said to my mom.

44
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,660
没事的 小茹
It's okay, Rue.

45
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,650
没事的
It's okay.

46
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,640
我多想说那些都不是真心的
I wish I could say I didn't mean any of it.

47
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,370
那是真话吗  至少我想过
Is that actually true? I mean, I thought it.

48
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,800
感受过  也说出口了
I felt it... I said it.

49
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,270
我知道大多数人会说
I'm sure most people would say

50
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,660
这世上没我更好
the world would be a better place without me.

51
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,330
我不否认
I don't disagree.

52
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,430
其实我从记事起
In fact, I've been trying to leave it

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,240
就在试着离开这个世界
for as long as I can remember.

54
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,570
阿里也是那种少见的人之一
Ali is also one of those rare people.

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,770
奇怪的是
The strange thing is,

56
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,450
我打赌大多数人会一致评价他说
I bet most people would say the same thing about him.

57
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,930
"他就是个打老婆的瘾君子"
"He's just a fuckin' crackhead wife-beater."

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,730
我敢说他女儿这么说过
I bet his daughter said that.

59
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,770
连我都多少说过
Even I kinda said that.

60
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,610
我后悔那样
That I regret.

61
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,410
真的很后悔
Really fucking regret.

62
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,700
但如果坦诚地说我是谁
But if I'm being honest about who I am...

63
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,770
我是撒谎精  是贼
I'm a liar, a thief.

64
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,140
我暴力  虐待  操纵人心
I'm violent, abusive, manipulative.

65
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,790
冷
It's cold.

66
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,770
冷  妈  妈  冷
It's cold, Mom. Mom, it's cold.

67
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:21,100
小茹  你得退烧  宝贝  好吗
Rue, you have to break your fever, baby, okay?

68
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,360
好吗  来
Okay? Come on.

69
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:24,260
即使我今天戒毒了
And even if I got clean today,

70
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,300
没人会忘记我吸毒时的创伤
no one would forget the trauma of me not being clean.

71
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,910
该死
Shit.

72
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,120
但我真的后悔对阿里说那些话
But I really regret what I said to Ali.

73
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,200
将某人的一生删减到一刻
Reducing someone's life to a moment...

74
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,100
丑陋的一刻
an ugly moment.

75
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,500
为那一刻而惩罚他们
And punishing them for it.

76
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,270
那是警察做的事
That's what cops do.

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,150
也是每个人都会做的事
It's actually what everyone does.

78
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,780
你如果不了解我  也会对我做这样的事
It's what you would do to me if you didn't know me.

79
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,480
总之  我应该打给阿里道歉
Anyway, I should call Ali and apologize.

80
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,360
喂
Hello.

81
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,250
阿里
Ali?

82
00:06:56,650 --> 00:06:58,560
是我  小茹
It's, um, it's Rue.

83
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,160
有事吗  小茹
What do you want, Rue?

84
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,440
我只是想打给你  告诉你
I just wanted to, uh, call you and tell you that, um...

85
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,260
我想打给你
I just wanted to call you

86
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,200
告诉你我很抱歉说了那些话
and tell you that I'm sorry for what I said.

87
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,380
我真的很后悔
and I really regret it.

88
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,470
我...  我不该说那些话
I just-- I never should've said that.

89
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:46,330
小茹
Rue.

90
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,430
-我很抱歉  对不起  -小茹
- And I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Rue!

91
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:49,630
听我说
Listen to me.

92
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,650
我原谅你
I forgive you.

93
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:08,660
真的
You do?

94
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:12,140
真的
I do.

95
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,400
你怎么知道我是真心的
How do you know that I mean it?

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,740
因为这一刻迟早会来
Because the hour is certain to come.

97
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,680
我们必须从容原谅
So we must forgive graciously.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,890
谢谢你
Thank you.

99
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

迷醉
第二季  第六集

101
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:28,900
你看着虚弱得像个林黛玉
You look like a cat coughed your ass up.

102
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
阿里说只有让他
Ali said he would only stop by

103
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,700
给我们全家做饭他才愿意来
if he could cook dinner for the whole family.

104
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,960
谢谢你们邀请我
Aw, thanks for having me.

我是阿里  很高兴认识你

-你是小茹的担保人  -是的
- You're Rue's sponsor? - Uh... I am.

108
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,050
不如说说  你这会儿在干嘛
A better question is, uh, what're you doin' right now?

109
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,480
没干嘛
Nothing.

110
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,180
-想帮我做饭吗  -我可以帮忙
- Wanna help me cook? - Uh, I can help.

111
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:00,970
算了算了  别让你戒断期间
Nah, nah, you keep your stank

112
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,280
拉稀的屁股把我的菜熏臭了
withdrawal diarrhea-ass all away from my food.

113
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,650
-你要不要告诉他...  -不  不
- Oh, you wanna tell him about-- - No, no!

00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:08,570
-我觉得你应该说  -不  不
- I think you should. - No, no, no!

115
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,070
我认真的  你威胁到我们健康了
Hey, yo, yo! I'm serious. You're a health hazard.

116
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:14,620
-回房去  -好吧  我去  谢了  抱歉
- In the other room. - Okay, dang. Thank you. Sorry.

117
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,610
拜拜
Bye-bye.

118
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,940
拜拜  你也拜拜
Bye-bye? Bye-bye to you, too.

119
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,070
我知道你肯定洗过她的臭屁股
I know you probably been washin' that ass.

120
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,850
她们知道我没说错
They know I'm right.

121
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,410
没错
Exactly.

122
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:36,750
我觉得她今天好多了
I think she's doin' better today.

123
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:42,030
比起小茹的艰难
For as tough as it's been on Rue,

124
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,990
我知道这对你来说更不容易
I'm sure it's been harder on you.

125
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,910
把这些番茄切块
Dice these tomatoes.

126
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,260
你可以生她的气
It's okay to be angry at her.

127
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:07,170
我觉得那样帮不到任何人
I'm not sure that helps anyone.

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,090
我看未必
Ah, well, oh, I... tend to disagree.

129
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,370
我觉得那对你有好处
I think it would actually be good for you.

130
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,690
怎么说
How?

131
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,880
生她的气错不在你
You're not wrong to be angry at her.

132
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,260
这种事很伤人
That shit hurts.

133
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,310
很不公平
It's unfair.

134
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,670
你不该承受这些
You don't deserve it.

135
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,530
我没事
I'm fine.

136
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,300
真的
I am.

137
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:42,260
我没说我不信你
I didn't say I didn't believe you.

138
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,520
内特还不知道凯茜和麦迪的事
Now, Nate didn't know what happened with Cassie and Maddy

139
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,560
因为他锻炼时手机静音
because when he exercises, he puts his phone on silent.

140
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,240
{\an8}凯茜: 我需要马上和你谈谈

141
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
{\an8}38个来自凯茜的未接电话

142
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
讽刺的是内特今早醒来
The irony was Nate woke up that morning

143
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,140
感觉好极了
feeling fantastic.

144
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,130
因为在和他爸斗了18年后
Because after an 18-year dick-swinging contest with his dad...

145
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:12,640
内特终于赢了
Nate had finally won.

146
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:18,340
他妈妈似乎应对自如
His mom seemed to be handling it well.

147
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,930
而另一边他哥却...
His brother on the other hand...

148
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,110
她在乐什么呢
Fuck is she so happy about?

149
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,730
不怎么样
not so well.

150
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,260
让他担心的
It wasn't the 38 missed calls

151
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,230
不是凯茜的38个未接来电
from Cassie that concerned him.

152
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,630
而是麦迪一个电话都没打
It was the fact that there were zero calls from Maddy.

153
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,420
内特那么爱麦迪的其中一个原因是
Part of the reason Nate loved Maddy as much as he did

154
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,260
她的忠诚
is because she was loyal.

155
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,810
也是这一点把他吓到腿软
But it's also what scared the living shit out of him.

156
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:06,100
惹毛她的人都会被弄死
If anyone crossed her, she'd bury them.

157
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,960
现在他真的惹毛她了
And he had now really fucking crossed her.

158
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,880
内特对麦迪要做什么
And there was no doubt in Nate's mind what Maddy

159
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,310
了如指掌
was about to do.

160
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,160
当一个孩子在校园里枪杀别人
You know when a kid shoots up a school

161
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,900
别人去采访他父母的时候
and they go to interview the parents,

162
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,660
那对父母说  "我们不知道
and the parents are like, "We had no idea.

163
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,080
他看着挺正常的"
He seemed, like, totally normal."

164
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,960
所有观众心想  "你这个白痴"
And everyone watching is like, "You're a fucking idiot."

165
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,690
我对凯茜就是这种感受
That's how I feel, but with Cassie.

166
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,140
听着  我从不信任她
Look, I never trusted her.

167
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:34,720
什么  为什么
What? Why?

168
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,630
因为她看上去像
Because she seems like the kind of person

169
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,210
会睡你男友的那种人
who would fuck your boyfriend.

170
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:41,870
我觉得我真的想杀了她
I think I actually wanna murder her.

171
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,860
我懂
I get it.

172
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,530
不  是真的
No, like, actually...

173
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,810
计划谋杀  付诸行动
plan a murder and carry it out.

174
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,480
我懂
I get it.

175
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:54,330
像那种震惊全国的可怕谋杀案
Like a grisly murder. One that shocks the nation.

176
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:57,260
这就不好懂了
I think that's more than understandable.

177
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,800
内特呢
What about Nate?

178
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,720
我有几个主意
I have a few ideas.

179
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,930
不是吧
No!

180
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,330
-好阴暗  -你们准备好点单了吗
- That's dark-sided. - Are you two ready to order?

181
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:17,980
不
No.

182
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,080
她还在打电话  我们过几分钟再点
she's just on the phone. We'll just be a couple minutes.

183
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,000
我们希望顾客在餐桌上不要使用手机
We prefer customers not use phones at the tables.

184
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,080
-不不不  -我能理解
- No, no, no. - I can understand.

185
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,450
那我过会儿再来
I will circle back.

186
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:30,980
好的  谢谢
Okay, thank you.

187
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,080
她是个贱人  对
She's a cunt, yeah.

188
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,610
好吧  再见  爱你  好的
All right, bye. Love you. Okay.

189
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,780
抱歉  我想着咱们还没问好呢
Sorry... I j-- We haven't said hello yet,

190
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,680
所以我决定
so I just figured

191
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,660
像平常那样来迎接你
I would greet you like I normally greet you.

192
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:50,850
对不起
Oh, sorry.

193
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:53,550
麦迪在经历一些事
Maddy's going through this thing. You know?

194
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,240
当然
Sure.

195
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:57,680
-我懂  很尴尬  -是啊
- I get it. It's awkward. - Yeah.

196
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:04,530
-我们在这儿干什么  -约会
- So, what are we doing here? - Goin' on a date.

197
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,550
是吗
Yeah?

198
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,520
因为在电话里你说得好像
'Cause on the phone you just kind of made it sound

199
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,640
是什么紧急事件一样
like, like it was an emergency.

200
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,170
-是吗  -是的
- Did I? - Yeah.

201
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:19,050
-不  -你问我能不能取消彩排
-No. -Like, you asked if I could cancel rehearsal.

202
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,760
我  我想说  我一直...
I, um, I mean, well, I've--

203
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,540
我一直...
I've...

204
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:31,360
在思考...  我们和我们的关系
been thinking... about us and, and our relationship,

205
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,970
以及...
and, um... um...

206
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,250
我得了...  脑紊乱
I have a... brain disorder.

207
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,460
什么
What?

208
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,380
我就说到这儿了
That's the rest of the sentence.

209
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,330
我很疑惑
Um, I'm confused.

210
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,170
我觉得已经是晚期了
I think it's terminal.

211
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,390
你思考了很久我们的关系
Y-Y-You've been thinking a lot about our relationship

212
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,280
因为你得了晚期脑紊乱
because you have a, you have a terminal brain disorder?

213
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,530
是啊  我一直在思考...
Yeah, I just, like, keep thinking, like,

214
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:10,990
所有医院探视  以及...
all the hospital visits, and...

215
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:13,580
我可能还得辍学
maybe, I'll have to get out of school,

216
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:14,870
待在家
stay home, you know,

217
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,550
享受仅剩不多的时间
with the little time I have left.

218
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,310
你得的晚期脑紊乱叫什么
What is this terminal brain disorder called?

219
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,790
不  不  不
No, no, no.

220
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,880
你会去谷歌上查  然后仔细阅读
'Cause you're gonna google it, and then read about it,

221
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,530
我就会在你脸上看到那副表情
and I'm just gonna see it on your face.

222
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:27,160
我感觉你在对我撒谎
I feel like you're l-lying to me.

223
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:31,650
撒谎得了晚期脑紊乱吗
Lying about a terminal brain disorder?

224
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:35,100
太可怕了吧
That's sick.

225
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,780
说实话  事实上你认为
A-And to be honest, the fact that you think

226
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,560
我会对你撒这样严重的谎
I would even lie about something that awful

227
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,730
就意味着我们的关系中存在很大问题
means there's a big problem in this relationship,

228
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,300
就像
which is, like,

229
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,750
我一开始想说的那样
literally what I was trying to say in the beginning.

230
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,990
不  不  一开始
No, no. In the beginning,

231
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,070
我就感觉你要跟我分手了
I feel like you started to break up with me,

232
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,770
然后你转移话题告诉我
and then, you pivoted to telling me that

233
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,050
你得了晚期脑疾
you got, like, a terminal brain illness,

234
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,370
现在我又感觉你在利用我的怀疑
and now, I feel like you're using my skepticism

235
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,420
当作和我分手的理由
as, like, a reason to break up with me.

236
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,040
那是你的感觉
That's your experience.

237
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:01,190
不  我觉得...  事实就是这样
No, I think... that's the experience.

238
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,390
是你对这件事的主观臆测
It's your experience of the experience--

239
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,740
凯特  如果你不想跟我在一起
Kat, you don't wanna be in a relationship with me.

240
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,400
我能理解  你可以直说
And I get it. If it's okay, just say it.

241
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,130
只要你有诚实表态的勇气
Just have, like, the courage to actually be honest

242
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,280
因为现在你的所作所为
'cause what you're doin' right now,

243
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,800
真的让人感觉很糟糕
it's just, like-- feels like shit.

244
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,320
我知道  我...
I knew it. I-- Wow.

245
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,790
我简直难以置信
Wow, I can't believe this.

246
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,390
你真的要跟我分手
You're literally trying to break up with me.

247
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,420
不  我只是在帮你说出你想说的
No, I'm, I'm trying to help you say what you wanna say.

248
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,390
这是什么
Is this some sort of, like,

249
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,180
你在恶臭男讨论区
manipulation tactic you learned

250
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,840
学到的操纵技巧吗
on some fucking incel Reddit forum?

251
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,340
老天  这就是你这种男人的问题
God, this is the problem with guys like you.

252
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,880
我告诉你我病了
I tell you I'm sick,

253
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,890
而你直接忽略我的经历
and you just dismiss my experience.

254
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:34,570
操纵我  告诉我怎样去感受
Yeah, you just gaslight me, tell me how to feel

255
00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:36,130
只因我达不到你的期望
all because I don't meet your expectations.

256
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,150
好吧  你说得对
All right, well, you're right.

257
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,410
你没有达到我的期望
You didn't live up to my expectations

258
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,730
因为我的确期望你至少能诚实
because I did expect you to at least be honest.

259
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,840
-我很诚实  -行吧
- I am being honest. - All right,

260
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,150
我甚至觉得这话你自己都不信
I don't even think you believe that,

261
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,580
但这都是次要的
but, you know, that's besides the point

262
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,210
因为我觉得我们该分手了
'cause I think we need to break up.

263
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,200
这我倒没料到
Wow, wow. I didn't see that one coming.

264
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,970
我也没有
I didn't either.

265
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:58,990
再见
Bye!

266
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,860
小莱
Lex...

267
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,900
亲爱的  把这些放后院藏到灌木里
Hon, take these in the back and hide 'em in the bushes.

268
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,410
你真觉得她会捅自己吗
You really think she's gonna stab herself?

269
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,990
你姐姐非常冲动...  是的
Your sister's very emotional... Yes.

270
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,170
-真的吗  -藏到灌木里  就现在
- Really? - In the bushes, now.

271
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,000
快去
Go!

272
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,010
快点
Hurry!

273
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:45,360
折断树枝来掩盖灌木丛中
It was at some point while breaking branches off a tree

274
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,750
那一篮子刀具的
in order to camouflage a bucket

275
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,580
某个时刻
of kitchen knives in a bush...

276
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,350
莱克茜开始
that Lexi started to have

277
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:52,880
重新思考是否要把她的剧本搬上舞台
second thoughts about putting on her play.

278
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,730
你知道...
Well, you know what...

279
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,290
最应该写进你剧本里的
what you should put in the play...

280
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,810
是我在派对上暴揍内特那次
that time I beat Nate's ass at that party.

281
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,200
才不是  天呐
No! Oh god.

282
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,300
我也不知道  凯茜现在状态不太好
I don't know. Cassie isn't doing too well.

283
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,630
我担心...
I'm worried that...

284
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,110
她会看到这个剧  然后  她会...
she's gonna see the play, and then, she's gonna...

285
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,950
崩溃
freak out.

286
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,820
是的  我想说...
Yeah, I mean...

287
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,240
每个人的感情都会受到伤害
everybody gets their feelings hurt. You know?

288
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,320
对
Yeah.

289
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,630
有些人...
Some people...

290
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,560
有些人的感情有时就是需要受伤
some people need to get their feelings hurt sometimes.

291
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,320
是啊  我...
Yeah... I--

292
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,640
感觉是我人生第一次
It's, like, the first time in my life

293
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,800
为自己做一些事
I'm doing something for myself.

294
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,140
我去
Shit.

295
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:36,850
这个剧本背后的想法是什么
What exactly is... the idea behind the play?

296
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,580
我不知道  就...  就是
I don't know, it's... it's, like,

297
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,830
关于一群好姐妹
about a group of girlfriends

298
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,990
她们...
who sort of...

299
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,310
一起长大又分道扬镳
grow up and grow apart.

300
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,540
我去  所以就像
Damn, so it's kinda like, uh,

301
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,060
-《伴我同行》那种感觉  -是的  没错
- "Stand By Me" Vibes. - Yes, exactly!

302
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,950
-我超爱那部电影  就是那样  -是啊
- I love that movie. That's... exactly it. - Hell yeah.

303
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,390
别说了  那部电影我看了大概五十遍
Come on now. I've watched that film, like, 50 times.

304
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,630
-真的吗  -那是我的最爱  信我
- Have you really? - That's my shit, come on.

305
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:06,990
实际上  我姥姥有这部电影的影碟
In fact, my, my grandma has it on DVD, you know?

306
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,830
要看吗
Should we watch it?

307
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,460
莱克茜需要清静一下
Lexi needed a break.

308
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:19,320
凯茜  我能用厕所吗
Cassie... can I use the bathroom?

309
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:20,700
不行
No.

310
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,650
我是内特
Yo, this is Nate.

311
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,120
我正忙  哔声后请留言
I'm busy. Leave a message at the beep.

312
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,370
我是内特  我正忙
Yo, this is Nate. I'm busy.

313
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:31,920
哔声后请留言
Leave a message at the beep.

314
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,350
不管你做什么
Whatever you do,

315
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,620
不要跟任何高中认识的人结婚
don't marry anyone you meet in high school.

316
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,450
我认真的  我过去也很有趣
I mean it. I used to be fun.

317
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,170
知道你不相信
And I know you don't believe me,

318
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,970
-但我那时很辣  -不  我相信你
- but I was fuckin' hot. - No, I believe you.

319
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,360
本可以得到任何我想要的东西
Yeah, well, could've had anything I wanted.

320
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,410
结果我却...  爱上了你爸爸
Then I just... fell in love with your dad.

321
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:57,080
-我很高兴他现在走了  -是啊
- Well, I'm very happy he's gone. - Yeah.

322
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,820
帮我个忙  别对我撒气
Do me a favor. Just... don't take your anger out on me.

323
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,470
我为何要对你生气
Why would I be angry at you?

324
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:06,580
因为你易怒
'Cause you're an angry guy.

325
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,100
不  我对爸爸很生气
No, I was angry at Dad.

326
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,710
这跟易怒很不一样
That's very different than, you know, being angry.

327
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,820
好吧  随便你怎么说
Okay... Whatever you say.

328
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,090
而且我认为在我发怒的时候
And I feel like when I was angry,

329
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,160
都有很正当的理由
I had a pretty good reason to be angry.

330
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,320
好吧  听着  我不是说发怒的人
Okay, look, I'm not, I'm not saying angry people

331
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,150
没有理由发怒
don't have a reason to be angry.

332
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,420
好吗  你讨厌你爸
Right? You hated your father.

333
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,730
这跟其他理由一样说得通
That's as good a reason as any.

334
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,790
对  但我指的是
Yeah, but that's my point.

335
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,190
我的怒气是针对他
My anger was directed toward him.

336
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,440
不是针对其他人
It's not just towards anyone.

337
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,740
那我就不知道了
Yeah, I don't know about that.

338
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,300
不  我的怒气是有特定对象的
No, it's not. It's fuckin' specific.

339
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,830
好  听着
Okay, look...

340
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,700
我们能轻松地聊会儿天吗
can we just have a nice time?

341
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,940
好吗
Yeah?

342
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,710
-好  -好的  谢谢
- Yeah. - Okay, thank you.

343
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,240
还得再来一瓶
Need another bottle.

344
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,580
我不是坏人
I'm not the bad guy.

345
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,300
所有人都看着我  好像我是坏人似的
Everyone keeps looking at me like I'm the bad guy,

346
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,910
但我不是坏人
but I'm not the bad guy!

347
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:53,260
-你也不是好人  -对  肯定不是
- Well, you're not the good guy. - Yeah, that's for sure.

348
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,030
所有人都认为内特和麦迪还在一起时
Everyone thinks that I was hooking up with Nate

349
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,430
我就跟他勾搭上了
when he and Maddy were still together,

350
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,950
但这不准确  时间上并不重合
but that's not accurate. There was no crossover.

351
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,500
凯茜  拜托  请冷静一点
Cassie, please, just a little bit of peace, please.

352
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,030
但小茹说得好像
But Rue made it sound like

353
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,730
我们一直在勾勾搭搭
we were just hooking up the entire time,

354
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,780
但我绝不会这样对我爱的人
but I would never do that to someone I love.

355
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:10,680
好吧  我认为这不是无懈可击的辩解
Yeah, I don't think that's a real airtight defense.

356
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,100
这是事实
It's the truth!

357
00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:14,270
凯茜  你快把我逼疯了
Oh, Cassie, you're driving me nuts!

358
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,930
你做过什么是一回事
It's one thing to do what you did,

359
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,990
装作完全无辜又是另一回事
and it's another thing to pretend you're all innocent,

360
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,320
-这不是什么大事  -我只是指出事实
- and it's no big deal. - I'm just pointing out the facts.

361
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,340
-我是在指出原则  -什么原则
- Well, I'm pointing out the principle. - What principle?

362
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,880
"别碰闺蜜男朋友"原则
The "Don't fuck your best friend's boyfriend" principle.

363
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,180
这就是我要跟你说的  妈
That is what I am trying to tell you, Mom!

364
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:31,100
他们当时不是男女朋友  天啊
They weren't boyfriend and girlfriend, god!

365
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:31,760
我不在乎
I don't care!

366
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,700
我只想安静地看一小时
I just wanna watch my "Millionaire Matchmaker"

367
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:35,390
《百万爱情介绍所》
in peace for one hour,

368
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,520
就一小时
one goddamn hour!

369
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:38,860
靠
Fuck!

370
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:42,680
你还在和那个金发姑娘见面吗
You, uh, you still seein' that, that, that blonde girl?

371
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:43,860
为什么这么问
Why?

372
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,070
因为相比麦迪我更喜欢她
'Cause I prefer her to Maddy.

373
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,050
你运气不错
Well, you're in luck.

374
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:50,300
所以你们在约会吗
So, so you're dating?

375
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,440
不  我是说
No, I just mean

376
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:54,150
麦迪永远不会再跟我说话了
Maddy's never gonna fuckin' talk to me again.

377
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,830
-那太好了  -走着瞧吧
- Oh, well, that's good. - Well, we'll see.

378
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,410
我  我之前很怕你把她肚子搞大
I was, I was just terrified you were gonna get her pregnant.

379
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,730
谁  麦迪吗
Who? Maddy?

380
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,870
她是那种会留着孩子只为刁难你的人
She's the type that would keep it just to spite you.

381
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,000
谢谢
Thank you.

382
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:09,380
我无法想象她当妈
Can't really picture her being a mom.

383
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,850
天啊  我可以
Ooh, man, I could.

384
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,980
尤其当这意味着她有机会
Especially if it meant she had the chance

385
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,830
一辈子坑死你
to screw you over for the rest of her life.

386
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:16,170
好吧  她没怀孕
Yeah, well, she's not fuckin' pregnant,

387
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,120
她也永远不会再跟我说话
and she's never gonna talk to me again.

388
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:21,230
那个金发姑娘呢
So... what about the blonde girl?

389
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,940
-一言难尽  -怎么了
- Oh, it's complicated. - Why?

390
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,580
她是麦迪最好的朋友
Um, she's Maddy's best friend.

391
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,970
我去
Shit.

392
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,850
谁才是那个贱人
Who's the cunt now?

393
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,290
你记得她说那话的时候吗
Do you remember when she said that?

394
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:41,120
-是的  我记得  -天啊
- Yes, I do remember. - Oh my god.

395
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,140
我知道这么说不对
I know it's not the right thing to say...

396
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:46,080
但你在那之后抓住她
but when you grabbed her after that, and you, like,

397
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,130
把她拽走  我就想"这才是我儿子"
pulled her ass off, I was thinkin', "That's my boy."

398
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,570
好吗  "为妈妈出头"
Huh? "Stickin' up for his mama."

399
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,630
天呐  我去
Oh my gosh. Shit.

400
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:57,490
-是啊  那么做太疯狂了  -我知道
- Yeah, it was a pretty insane thing to do. - I know, well,

401
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,160
你不必掐住她的脖子
you know, you didn't have to go so far as to choke her.

402
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,460
-我没掐她脖子  -好吧
- I didn't choke her. - Mmm.

403
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,010
-妈  他们撤销了指控  -好的
- Mom, they dropped the charges. - Okay.

404
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,390
-我没掐她脖子  -听着
- I didn't fuckin' choke her. - Look...

405
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,810
在那一刻  我也想掐死那姑娘
at that moment, I, I wanted to choke the girl, too.

406
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,940
行  但我要说的是我没掐她  妈
Yeah, but my point is I didn't fucking choke her, Mom.

407
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,410
知道了
Okay!

408
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:17,560
别那么生气到最后要掐我脖子了
Don't get so upset that ya end up chokin' me.

409
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,020
因为我不会撤销指控
'Cause I won't drop the charges.

410
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,200
我会清理门户
I'll fuckin' clean house.

411
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,290
抱歉
Sorry.

412
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,680
发生什么事了
What's going on?

413
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,950
我想死
I just wanna die!

414
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,540
开瓶器割不开的
Well, a corkscrew ain't gonna cut it.

415
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,660
不...
No...

416
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,800
我早就说了
I told you.

417
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,410
我不明白  我以为你讨厌内特
I don't understand. I thought you hated Nate.

418
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,620
我那时不了解他
When I didn't know him.

419
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,980
你和他已经认识很久了
You've literally known him forever.

420
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,520
和我现在了解的不同
Not like I do now.

421
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:01,080
等等  这就是你背叛菲兹克的原因吗
Wait, is this why you ratted on Fezco?

422
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,140
不是
No.

423
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,810
天呐  所以你才那么做吗
Oh my god. That's why you did it?

424
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:05,480
-不是  -这就是你为什么会那么说吗
- No! - That's why you said something?

425
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,800
-因为你当时在和他上床  -我没有
- 'Cause you were sleeping with him? - No, I wasn't!

426
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,380
真的吗  你们什么时候开始上床的
Oh really? When did you start sleeping together?

427
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,150
我不...  我不知道具体日期
Uh... I, I don't, I don't know the exact date.

428
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:16,570
好吧  是跨年派对之前还是之后
Okay, well, was it before or after New Year's?

429
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,500
我不知道
I don't know!

430
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,010
好吧  但对你这么痴迷于
Okay, but for someone who's so obsessed with

431
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,770
时间管理的人来说  我不信
windows of time, I find that hard to believe.

432
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,200
天啊  莱克茜  你让我感觉更糟了
God, Lexi, you are making me feel worse!

433
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,540
你知道菲兹克为什么要那么做吗
Do you even know why Fezco did what he did?

434
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,060
-不  难道你知道  -对
- No, do you?! - Yeah, I do.

435
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,150
那就告诉我
Then tell me.

436
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,840
我会不告诉你的  因为你会告诉内特
No, I'm not gonna tell you because you'll tell Nate.

437
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,210
-我不相信你  -没人相信我
- I don't fuckin' trust you. - No one does!

438
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,440
对  因为你爱上了一个
Yeah, 'cause you fell in love with someone

439
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,900
多年来一直取笑你的人  太可悲了
who spent years making fun of you. It's sad.

440
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,530
你知道爸背着你搞外遇吗
Did you know Dad was cheating on you?

441
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,580
你知道吗
Did you?

442
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,450
不知道
No.

443
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,820
我  我根本不相信
I don't, I don't believe that for a second

444
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,460
因为他来这里时
because when he came in here

445
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,790
一边怒气冲冲地大吼说
and he was ranting and raving about

446
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,880
他是个男人  一边标记自己的地盘
bein' a man, and markin' his territory--

447
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,170
我根本不知道他在说什么
I don't know, whatever the fuck he was talking about.

448
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:05,100
我看了看艾伦  再看了看你
I looked at Aaron and I looked at you,

449
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,270
天啊  你和他的反应
and, boy, was there a difference

450
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,580
截然不同
in his response and your response.

451
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,480
因为艾伦是个蠢货
It's because Aaron is a fucking idiot.

452
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,680
好吧  他就是个蠢货
Okay, he is, isn't he?

453
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,590
这太糟了  笑死我了
That's terrible. I'm laughing.

454
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:25,710
知道吗
You know what?

455
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,620
我想买台健身器
I think I'm gonna buy a Peloton.

456
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,850
-对  我要开始约会  -你是个酒鬼
- Yeah, I am gonna start dating. - You're a drunk.

457
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,460
怎么  你不想要继父吗
Mm, what? You don't want a stepfather?

458
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,270
-妈  闭嘴  -不要吗
- Mom, shut up. - No? Ooh, ooh!

459
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,820
你的同龄人怎么样  那会很有趣
What about one who's your age? That'd be fun.

460
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,660
闭嘴
Shut the fuck up.

461
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,130
你幼稚得像个青少年
You're acting like a fuckin' teenager.

462
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,720
-我的老天啊  -真厉害
- Jesus fuckin' Christ. - Wow!

463
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:43,760
为什么  你为什么
Why is it, why is it that you only have

464
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,100
只继承了你爸的缺点
the bad qualities of your father,

465
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:48,990
-一点优点都没继承呢  -好吧
- and none of the good qualities? - Okay.

466
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,810
行  所以卡尔现在成圣人了
Right, so Cal, Cal's a fuckin' saint now.

467
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,370
不  我...  我没这么说
No. That's, that's, that's not what I said.

468
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,140
你就是这么说的
That's literally what you fuckin' said.

469
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,480
不  我没有  我只是...
No, it's not. I just--

470
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,050
他有严重的性格缺陷  不知为什么
He's deeply flawed, and somehow...

471
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,350
我们却以某种方式
somehow, some way, we

472
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,130
培养出一个性格缺陷更严重的孩子
raised a child who's even more deeply flawed.

473
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:11,320
你有想过吗  你有想过...
Do you ever wonder about that? Do you just like--

474
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,520
到底哪里出了错  你想过吗
What went wrong? Do you ever think about that?

475
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,530
当然没有  你不会想
No, of course, you don't

476
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,610
因为你那个蠢货爹
because your fuckin' dumb-ass dad

477
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,540
不相信心理治疗  所以
didn't believe in therapy, so...

478
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,590
你不可能自我反省  只是...
self-reflection's off the table. It's just--

479
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,720
只是我不理解
It's just a mystery to me.

480
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:30,360
因为你从前是多么可爱的孩子
'Cause you were such a sweet little baby.

481
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:35,250
我记得你过去晚上常来我们卧室
I remember you used to come to our bedroom at night,

482
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,740
你会问我
and you would, you would ask me

483
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,460
入睡前想不想
if I wanted anything to drink,

484
00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:41,380
喝点什么  有时我会说
you know, before bed, and sometimes I'd say,

485
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,120
"是的  我想喝杯水"
"Yeah," you know, "I want a glass of water,"

486
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,990
就想看看你是否真的会去倒水
just to see if you'd, if you'd do it, if you meant it,

487
00:27:45,990 --> 00:27:47,010
而你去倒了
and you did.

488
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:50,080
你会把水端来  好吗
Hm, you'd bring it up, right?

489
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,500
把水放在床头柜上
You'd put it on the nightstand,

490
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,070
然后轻轻亲我一下
and then, you'd give me a little kiss,

491
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:56,050
告诉我你爱我
and you'd tell me you loved me.

492
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,510
然后你看向你爸
Then you'd look over at your dad,

493
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:00,100
告诉他你也爱他
and... you'd tell him you loved him, too,

494
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,960
但没亲他
but without the kiss.

495
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,840
然后  我不知道  差不多
And then... I don't know, somewhere, like, around...

496
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:10,480
八九岁时  你变抑郁了
eight or nine, you just, you-you darkened.

497
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,500
你还记得那些年吗
Do you remember those years?

498
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,850
-不记得了  -天啊  我曾问你爸说
- Not really, no. - God, I used to ask your dad,

499
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:21,780
"他被棒球砸中头了吗
I was like, "Did a baseball hit him in the head?

500
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:23,550
"他得了脑震荡吗  出什么事了
"Did he get a concussion? Did something happen?

501
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,050
我  我不明白"
I just-- I don't understand."

502
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:27,290
简直判若两人  我发誓...
It was such a drastic change, and I, I swear--

503
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,240
有什么意义  说这些有什么意义
What's the fucking point? What's the point of all this?

504
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,290
听着  我只是想搞清
Look, I'm just-- I'm just tryin' to figure out

505
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:33,740
事情怎么最终变成这个样子  仅此而已
how things ended up the way they ended up. That's all.

506
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,260
我觉得你话里有话
I feel like you're tryin' to say something without sayin' it.

507
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,600
我没有
I-I'm not.

508
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,600
忘记我...
Just... forget I--

509
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:06,160
谁说内特是坏人来着  小茹吗
Who said Nate was a bad person? Rue?

510
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,500
这不重要
It doesn't matter.

511
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,180
因为如果我们想谈论人
'Cause if we wanna talk about people,

512
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,660
-那就谈谈小茹吧  -小茹是个好女孩
- let's talk about Rue. - Rue's a good girl.

513
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,130
我就不是吗
And I'm not?

514
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,250
我没说你不是好女孩
I didn't say you're not a good girl.

515
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,830
小茹过得很艰难
Rue's had a very hard life.

516
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,000
也没我和莱克茜艰难
Not harder than my life or Lexi's life.

517
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,850
-不一样  -行吧
- It's different. - Right.

518
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,170
她爸死了  我们的爸爸没联系了
Her dad died and ours just stopped calling.

519
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,970
我不知道哪个更糟
I don't know which is worse.

520
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,710
如果你不是个没自尊的
And if you weren't such a fucking loser

521
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:30,640
窝囊废
with no self-respect,

522
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,610
你就放弃她了
you'd drop her 'cause she

523
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,850
-因为她对你糟透了  -够了  够了
- treats you like shit. - Enough! Enough!

524
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,290
怎么  我不能这么说她
What, I can't say it to her,

525
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,670
你俩却可以这么说我
but you two can say it to me?!

526
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,760
我从没说过你没有自尊
I never said you didn't have any self-respect!

527
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,920
不用你说  我他妈感觉到了
You don't have to! I can fuckin' feel it!

528
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,800
真该给她驱个邪
Oh, she needs a fucking exorcism.

529
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,440
事实是  内特根本不在乎
The truth was, Nate didn't give a shit

530
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,370
他爸会怎么样
about what would happen to his dad.

531
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,670
但他确实
He did, however,

532
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,260
很关心他爸的生意会怎样
care about what happened to his dad's business

533
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:03,220
因为最终都会成为他的生意
because, eventually, that would become Nate's business.

534
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,650
虽然他不怎么了解房地产
And while he didn't know much about real estate...

535
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
但他知道
he did know there wasn't

536
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,570
恋童癖建的房子没什么市场
much of a market for homes built by a pedophile.

537
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,480
{\an8}享受成为一家之主的感觉吧

538
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,740
恋童癖儿子建的房子也一样
or the son of a pedophile.

539
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,440
虽然严格说来  他不是恋童癖
Even though, technically, he wasn't a pedophile,

540
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,320
但也不可能大声争辩
but it's not like you could argue that out loud.

541
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,470
此时  茱尔丝在家
Meanwhile, Jules was at home.

542
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:55,920
她再也没和埃利奥特说话  自从...
And she hadn't talked to Elliot since...

543
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:56,920
告诉你吧
You know what?

544
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,470
其实  我不想谈茱尔丝和埃利奥特
Actually, I don't want to talk about Jules and Elliot.

545
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:02,090
去他们的  我们谈回麦迪
Fuck them. Let's go back to Maddy.

546
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,040
然后  有两个王嘘[任天堂旗下角色]
Then, there are two King Boo's,

547
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,040
然后  有三个王嘘
and then, three King Boo's.

548
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,820
麦迪不只是生内特和凯茜的气
Maddy wasn't just angry about Nate and Cassie.

549
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:12,750
她还很沮丧  心碎
She was also depressed and heartbroken.

550
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,340
凯茜一直在安慰她
All the times that Cassie consoled her,

551
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:24,360
安抚她  假装陪着她
comforted her, pretended to be there for her...

552
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,450
都不是真的
none of it was real.

553
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,370
都是错觉
It was all an illusion.

554
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,780
{\an8}萨曼莎: 15分钟内到家

555
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:17,640
-今晚怎么样  -很棒
- How was your night? - It was nice.

556
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,670
我有段时间没见闺蜜们了
I hadn't seen my girlfriends in a while,

557
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:21,010
能聊点毫无意义
so it was good to catch up

558
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:23,450
但有趣的东西挺好的
on all the meaningless, fun bullshit.

559
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,050
西奥和我打了两个半小时游戏
Well, Theo and I played two and a half hours of video games,

560
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:29,890
他告诉我他很喜欢恶魔
and then, he told me about how he loves demons,

561
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,870
我睡觉时  他们会偷走我的心
and that when I sleep, they're gonna steal my heart.

562
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:34,900
这孩子比较怪
He's a nut.

563
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,630
我们应该喝个烂醉  然后去游泳
Feel like we should get drunk and go for a swim.

564
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,240
好
Okay.

565
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,160
麦迪不想告诉萨曼莎
Maddy didn't wanna tell Samantha

566
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,480
内特和凯茜的事
what had happened with Nate and Cassie.

567
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,840
但两杯酒下肚
But after two glasses of wine...

568
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,110
她就把他俩的事跟她说了
she told her what had happened with Nate and Cassie.

569
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,810
-太糟糕了  -对吧
- God, that's horrible. - Right?

570
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:05,450
-你想听更糟糕的事吗  -什么
- You want to hear something more horrible? - What?

571
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,970
我上大学时
When I was in college,

572
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:10,540
也对我一个好朋友做了这种事
I kind of did the same thing to one of my best friends.

573
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,700
-你说你是我  -不
- You mean you were me? - No.

574
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,830
那就没那么糟了  我是她
No, that'd be less horrible. I, I was her.

575
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,710
别告诉我  我还挺喜欢你的
Don't tell me that. I like you.

576
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:21,410
-千万别和我说  -知道知道
- Please don't tell me that. - Yeah, I know, I know.

577
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,650
你上了你闺蜜的男朋友
You fucked one of your girlfriend's boyfriends?

578
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,350
很多次
Yeah, multiple times.

579
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,580
你对好几个闺蜜都这么做了
You did this to multiple girlfriends?

580
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,430
不  天啊  只有一个
No! Jesus. Just one.

581
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:34,330
很多次
Yeah... many times.

582
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,240
好吧  你们有多要好
Okay, but how close were you?

583
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,710
-别这样对我  -对不起
- No, don't do this to me. - I know. I'm sorry.

584
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,240
为什么
Why?

585
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,730
因为他在错误的时间
Because he gave me just the right

586
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,910
给了我恰到好处的关注
amount of attention at the wrong time.

587
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,780
太难过了
That is so depressing.

588
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,250
我在高中  大学和20多岁时
I was a fucking mess in high school...

589
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,500
都一团糟
in college, and in my 20s.

590
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,170
一想到世上有人愿意和我安顿下来
The idea that there was ever anyone in the world

591
00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,660
并和我结婚
who... would want to settle down and marry me

592
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,650
我就很震惊
was a complete shock to me.

593
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,530
-你在说谎  -我没有
- You're lying. - No. I'm not.

594
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,150
我真的是那种
I was, literally,

595
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:15,880
每个人和他们母亲常提的女孩
the girl that everyone and their mothers used to say,

596
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,260
"没有人会安顿下来娶她
"No one would ever settle down and marry her,

597
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:20,450
上帝保佑娶她的人"
and God-help whoever did."

598
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,360
他们为什么这么说
Why would they say that?

599
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,400
因为我一团糟
Because I was messy.

600
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,510
我喜欢吵架
Oh, and I loved to fight.

601
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:30,040
我不是一团糟  但我喜欢吵架
See, I'm not a mess, but I do love a fight.

602
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,510
-这样最好  -完全被低估了
- Oh, it's the best. - Totally underrated.

603
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,820
长远来看  没那么重要
In the long run, not so much,

604
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,050
-但在当下  -酷毙了
- but in the moment? - It's fucking amazing.

605
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,890
太棒了
Oh, it's so good.

606
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:42,120
-但这就是我  -是吗
- But... I mean, that's just who I am. - Yeah?

607
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,710
我以前也这么认为  直到遇见塞巴斯蒂安
I used to think that's who I was, too, until I met Sebastian.

608
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:47,200
你不吵架了
You don't fight?

609
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,970
不怎么吵
Not really, no.

610
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,370
-真的吗  -嗯
- Really? - Yeah.

611
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,400
我觉得我的大脑没法那样
I just don't think my brain is wired that way.

612
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,560
如果你四十多岁还和这种男人约会
If you are still dating guys like this in your 40s,

613
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,270
我们的对话会大不一样
we'd be having a very different conversation,

614
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,370
但你才十八岁  谁在乎啊
but you're 18 years old. Who gives a shit?

615
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,810
你和你朋友和好了吗
Did you and your friend ever make up?

616
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:11,150
没有  她再也没和我说话
God no. She never spoke to me again.

617
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,470
{\an8}导演
罗伯·莱纳

618
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,950
{\an8}编剧
雷纳尔多·吉迪恩  布鲁斯·A·埃文斯

619
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,010
天啊
Oh god.

620
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,880
太伤感了
It's so sad.

621
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,900
眼睛里好像进东西了
Think I got somethin' in my fuckin' eye.

费伊  过来
Faye! Come here.

645
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,870
他妈的快点
Hurry the fuck up!

646
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:40,060
-你在干什么  -我得和你谈谈
- What are you doing? - I gotta talk to you.

647
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,650
你为什么在巷子里
Why are you in the alley?

648
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,690
然后条子敲我的门
And then, so the fucking cops knock on my door,

649
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:56,610
-问各种问题  -什么问题
- askin' all kinds of questions. - What questions?

650
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:59,240
-有关"老鼠"的问题  -你说什么了
- Questions about Mouse. - What did you say?

651
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,440
什么也没说  但第二天我在街上走
Nothing. But then, the next day I was walking,

652
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,160
我口袋里有些奥施康定
and I'm like-- I had a couple OCs in my pocket,

653
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,550
他们就跑过来  说些疯话
and they just ran up talkin' all kinds of crazy shit.

654
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,130
你要坐牢了  我们知道是你杀了"老鼠"
You know, "You're gonna go to prison. We know you killed Mouse."

655
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,070
我说  我没杀"老鼠"
I was like, "I, I didn't kill Mouse."

656
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
你跟他们合作了
Are you cooperating?

657
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:13,660
当然没有
Hell no.

658
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,460
宝贝  他们已经盯上小菲和"烟缸弟"了
Babe, they already had their sights set on fuckin' Fez and Ash.

659
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,260
所以你在和警方合作
So, you are cooperating with the police.

660
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,570
我不知道这个词对不对
I do not know if that is the right word,

661
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:23,090
但我是在帮他们
all right, but I'm helping 'em out.

662
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:25,210
他们肯定之前就盯上他们了
Okay, they definitely had their sights set on them beforehand,

663
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,650
所以我什么也没做
so I didn't set anything into motion.

664
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:27,650
我爱你  宝贝
I love you, baby,

665
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,210
我很快就会过来
and I'm gonna be coming over soon,

666
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,910
和你谈些事
and I'm gonna be talkin' about some things,

667
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:33,520
你别插手
and I need you to stay the fuck out of it.

668
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:52,340
在下雨
Oh, hey, it's raining.

669
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,590
我要去洗个澡
I'm gonna take a shower.

670
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,030
很难做啊
This shit go hard.

671
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,980
但说真的
But for real though, if,

672
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:22,280
如果你的剧本像《伴我同行》一样
if your play is anything like "Stand By Me,"

673
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:25,360
你肯定没问题的
you're not gonna have no problems.

674
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:31,000
{\an8}笑一个  你入镜了

675
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,740
你在干什么
What are you doing?

676
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,140
别担心  我不是来道歉的
Don't worry. I'm not here to apologize.

677
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,390
你能想象我坐在这拿把枪
Can you imagine if I was sitting here with a gun

678
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,140
逼你接受我的道歉吗
forcing you to accept my apology?

679
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,800
-你吓到我了  -是啊
- You're scaring me. - Yeah...

680
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:44,870
说到点上了
It's kinda the point.

681
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:02,020
我爱你  我爱你  内特
I love you. I love you, Nate.

682
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:04,480
内特  我爱你
Nate... I love you.

683
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,230
我比世上的任何人都了解你
I know you better than anyone in this world.

684
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,500
我羞辱了你
I humiliated you.

685
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,760
我们结束了
It's over.

686
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,970
你觉得我爸为什么喜欢拍性爱录像
Why do you think my dad likes to film himself fucking?

687
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,470
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

688
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,070
你敢信那是茱尔丝吗
Can you believe it was Jules?

689
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:20,350
我要那张碟
I'm gonna need that disc now.

690
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,670
我没有
I don't have it.

691
00:42:28,790 --> 00:42:29,660
好
Okay.

692
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:33,800
行
Okay.

693
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,890
深呼吸
Take a deep breath.

694
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:08,170
别这样  内特
Stop it, Nate.

695
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,070
住手  内特  停
Stop, Nate, stop.

696
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,390
求你停下
Please, please stop.

697
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:20,890
求你住手  求你了
Please, stop it, stop it, please.

698
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,870
求你停下
Please, stop it.

699
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,440
停停停
Stop, stop, stop.

700
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,310
在...  在我包里
It's in, it's in my purse.

701
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,090
碟在我包里  在我包里
It's in my purse. It's in my purse.

702
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,630
对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

703
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,050
对不起  我...
I'm sorry. I was--

704
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,830
-我开玩笑...  -别碰我
- I was jok-- - Don't touch me!

705
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:19,860
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

706
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:22,010
枪里没有子弹
There's no bullets in the gun.

707
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,550
再见
Goodbye.

708
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,290
{\an8}未知来电

709
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,000
-喂  -听着  我知道你可能不想跟我谈
- Hello? - Look, I know you probably don't wanna talk to me,

710
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:24,800
但我快到你家外面了
but I'm about to be outside your house,

711
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,740
我真的得和你谈谈
and I really need to speak to you.

712
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,020
我不在乎
I don't care.

713
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,480
{\an8}内特: 是关于我爸

714
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,280
{\an8}和你

715
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:45,930
{\an8}内特: 我只是希望你能保护自己

716
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,200
{\an8}内特: 我在前门外

717
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:21,660
不用  谢谢
No, thank you.

718
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,000
见到你真好
It's good to see you.

719
00:46:29,330 --> 00:46:30,970
我知道你恨我
I know you hate me.

720
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,600
我做了很多坏事
I've done a lot of shitty things,

721
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:37,040
但这不是其中一个
but, um... no, this isn't one of 'em.

722
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,470
你想干嘛
What do you want?

723
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:42,190
首先  向你道歉
First... to apologize.

724
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:43,970
我没兴趣
I'm not interested.

725
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:46,420
我知道  但你对第二件事肯定感兴趣
I know, but you are gonna be interested in the second thing.

726
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:47,470
对你来说不幸的是
Unfortunately for you,

727
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,580
你得先听我的道歉
you're gonna have to hear my apology first.

728
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,680
对不起  
I'm sorry...

729
00:46:56,950 --> 00:46:58,900
为我对你所做的一切感到抱歉
for everything that I've done to you.

730
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,300
你不该承受这些
You didn't deserve it.

731
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,570
我...  我当时是想保护
I was, uh... I was tryin' to protect somebody

732
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:11,100
一个不值得被保护的人
that didn't deserve to be protected.

733
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,580
如果可以的话我愿意收回一切
If I could take it all back, I would.

734
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,550
但事已至此
But... I did what I did.

735
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,120
我从这张碟里发现
I found out about you and my dad from, um...

736
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,050
你和我爸的事
from this disc.

737
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,030
他偷偷录下了每一次约炮
Yeah, he, uh, he secretly records every encounter he has,

738
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,730
说实话  从我记事起
and, you know, he's been doin' it, well...

739
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,160
他就一直这么干
well, honestly, as long as I can remember.

740
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,950
我从他那偷了这张碟  他崩溃了
I stole it from him, and he had a, he had a mental breakdown,

741
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,590
他搬了出去
and he moved out of the house,

742
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:51,620
所以我想我可以...
so I thought that I would, uh--

743
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:55,160
我想把它给你  
I thought I'd give it to you, and, you know, you can

744
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,860
凭你处置
do with it as you please.

745
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:01,510
-所以那里有摄像头  -对
- So, there was a camera? - Yes.

746
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,740
你看过了吗
And you've seen it?

747
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:07,260
是的
Yeah.

748
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,090
-很多人看过吗  -不  没有
- Have a lot of people seen it? - No, no.

749
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:14,310
他知道你把它给我吗
Does he know you're giving this to me?

750
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,520
不知道  不然他会杀了我
No... No. He would fuckin' kill me.

751
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,240
这是唯一一份吗  还是...
Is this, like, the only copy, or...

752
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,530
有其他的备份
is it other, other places?

753
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,870
据我所知就这一份
I mean, it's the only one that I know of, yeah.

754
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,260
你为什么要给我
Why are you giving this to me?

755
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:38,630
说实话  答案很简单  也挺傻的
Honestly, the answer is too stupid and simple.

756
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,480
我觉得我们对这件事保密比较好
I think it's better if we just keep it a mystery.

757
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:44,010
什么  你现在成好人了吗
What, did you become, like, a good person?

758
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:46,330
绝对不是  不
Absolutely not, no.

759
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,860
你真该看看我为了拿到它做了什么
I mean, you should've seen what I had to do to get it.

760
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,110
我出来的时候袖子里藏了把美工刀
I came out here with a box cutter in my sleeve.

761
00:48:57,830 --> 00:48:59,670
以防出现
You know, in, in case there was a chance

762
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,660
我要割你喉的情况
I might have to slit your throat.

763
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,320
我就是这么不相信你
That's how little I trust you.

764
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:11,850
谢谢
Well, uh, thank you.

765
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,130
不客气
You're welcome.

766
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,750
-我要走了  -好的
- Um, I'm gonna go. - Okay.

767
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:25,570
不管怎样
Hey, um... for what it's worth...

768
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,020
我说的一切都是真的
everything I ever said was true.

769
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,470
我也是
Same here.

770
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:14,290
-喂  -打包行李
- Hello? - Hey, pack a suitcase.

771
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:15,960
我十分钟后到你家
I'll be at your place in 10.

772
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:18,600
-你可以住我家  -好
- You can stay at my house. - Okay.

773
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:19,850
爱你
Love you.

774
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,080
我也爱你
I love you, too.

775
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,390
{\an8}内特: 到了

776
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,020
我为你毁了我的人生
I ruined my entire life for you.

777
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:04,570
-你多大了  -22
- How old are you? - Uh, 22.

778
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,390
私心里...
Selfishly...

779
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,970
我希望你留下
I hope you stay.

780
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,180
张大点
Wider.

781
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:22,120
张大点  很好
Wider... There you go.

782
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:23,870
很好
That's it.

783
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:25,720
真乖
Good girl.

784
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:43,230
小茹  小茹
So, Rue, Rue.

785
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,740
你觉得自己坠入谷底了吗
So, you think you hit rock bottom?

786
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:50,990
是的
Yes.

787
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:57,170
好吧  我知道
Um... okay, uh, I know...

788
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:01,320
自己要向很多人道歉
that I have a lot of apologizing to do.

789
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,590
我懂
Uh... I get that.

790
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:07,460
所以我觉得我要...
So, I just figured that I'd, you know...

791
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:12,650
去戒毒所戒毒  整理好自己
go to rehab, get clean, you know, sort my shit out, and, um...

792
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,940
然后回来道歉
then come back, and... apologize.

793
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,320
所以你想戒毒吗
So you wanna get clean?

794
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:22,640
-对  -好的
- Yeah. - Okay.

795
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,000
你对此有什么感觉
How do you feel about that?

796
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:32,040
如果是真的  那挺好
If it's real, then great.

797
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,820
-是真的  -你之前也这么说过
- It is. - You've said that before.

798
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,360
吉雅  别这样
Gia, come on.

799
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,410
她不信她有什么问题吗
What's wrong with her not believin' her?

800
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,000
我觉得她需要我们所有人的支持  好吗
I think she needs all of our support. Right?

801
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,510
我不觉得这是支持的问题
I don't think it's a question of support.

802
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:50,160
当你让别人一次又一次失望
When you've let someone down again and again,

803
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,260
失去一点信心无可厚非
I think it's fair to lose a little faith.

804
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,820
你怎么看呢
I mean, what do you think?

805
00:54:58,240 --> 00:54:59,880
觉得她会戒毒吗
You think she'll get clean?

806
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,290
我不知道
I don't know.

807
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,540
她说有百分之五左右的机会  对吗
She said it's like a five percent chance, right?

808
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:10,100
差不多吧
Somethin' like that.

809
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:13,660
那有什么希望呢
Where's the hope in that?

810
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:20,900
这就要靠小茹自己去找了
The hope... is what Rue has to find.

811
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:29,140
没错  小菜一碟
Yeah... piece of cake.

812
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:39,100
让小茹做自己
Let Rue be Rue--

813
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,860
也给予小女儿足够的爱
and shower that little one with love.

814
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,610
她一直在等
She's been waitin' on it.

815
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,980
介意我晚上和你睡吗
You mind if I sleep in your bed tonight?

816
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:01,450
当然不了  来吧
Yeah, yeah, for sure. Come on.

817
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:32,310
我感觉对你的生活一无所知了
I feel like I don't know anything about your life anymore.

818
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,040
等你回来我会告诉你的
I'll tell you when you get back.

819
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:42,470
好
Okay.

820
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,880
-晚安  -晚安
- Good night. - Night.

821
00:56:56,040 --> 00:56:56,980
喂
Hello?

822
00:56:58,450 --> 00:56:59,860
对  是我
Yes, this is her.

823
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:06,200
对  我女儿  她17岁
Yeah, my daughter. She's 17 years old.

824
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:12,950
鸦片剂  海...  海洛因
I think opiates, hero-heroin.

825
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,500
我觉得主要就是鸦片剂
I think mainly just opiates.

826
00:57:18,470 --> 00:57:21,660
我大概四天前带她去了急诊室
Well, I t-took her to the emergency room about four days ago,

827
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:26,520
医生给了她什么来缓解戒断反应

你不了解我女儿  好吗

她是瘾君子  她要自杀

她需要住院  而不只是脱瘾治疗

她需要回到戒毒所

我了解我的女儿  她会自杀的

请你不要这样做  求你了
Please don't do this, please. I'm begging.
